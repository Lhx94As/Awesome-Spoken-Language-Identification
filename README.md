# Awesome-Spoken-Language-Identification
An awesome spoken LID repository. (Working in progress  
If you know some interesting papers, challenge, etc. that I haven't put in this repo, feel free to tell me!  
# Useful Links:  
## Datasets:  
[openslr](https://openslr.org/resources.php) (open-source, plenty of datasets!)  
[Common-Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en) (open-source, thousands of hours)  
## Workshops/Challenges:  
1. [OLR Challenge](http://cslt.riit.tsinghua.edu.cn/mediawiki/index.php/OLR_Challenge_2020): An Annual challenge, it is a special session in Interspeech 2021.  
2. [NIST LRE (the latest is LRE 2017)](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/language-recognition): The NIST LRE data are the most commonly used data for LID task in Interspeech, ICASSP and other top conferences/journals.  
3. [1st WSTC of Interspeech 2020](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/workshop-on-speech-technologies-for-code-switching-2020/): A workshop on Speech Technologies for Code-switching in Multilingual Communities.  
## Toolkits:
1. [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.org/) (Gorgeous toolkit, the LID parts are egs/LRE and egs/LRE07)  
2. [XMUspeech](https://github.com/Snowdar/asv-subtools#2-ap-olr-challenge-2020-baseline-recipe-language-identification) (A toolkit bases on kaldi&pytorch, developed by Xiamen University's team)  
## Papers:  
(from 2018 to now, yet I am updating the paper list)  
An overview (stronly recommend): [Spoken Language Recognition: from fundamental to practice](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6451097)
